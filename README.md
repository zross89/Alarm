# Alarm Clock

## Description

This is a Python script that allows you to set an alarm for a specific time of day. The script prompts the user to input the desired alarm time in hours and minutes, as well as whether the time is in the AM or PM. The script then continuously checks the current time and sounds an alarm when the desired alarm time is reached.

The alarm sound is played using the `playsound` library, which must be installed for the script to work.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you will need the following:

- Python 3 installed on your computer
- The `playsound` library installed. This can be installed using `pip install playsound`.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone or download the code from this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python 3 and the `playsound` library, if you haven't already.
3. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script by entering `python alarm_clock.py`.
5. Follow the prompts to enter the desired alarm time and AM/PM.
6. The script will continuously check the time and sound the alarm when the desired alarm time is reached. To stop the alarm, press Ctrl+C.
